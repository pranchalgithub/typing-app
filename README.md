# Typing Test React App

Hi! I have made a typing test react application for an assignment which follows the below use cases.

The code logic provides the basic functionality of :
1) A typing box wherein the user is typing keys
2) The user is able to see the keys theyâ€™re supposed to type next
3) Measuring the number of keys pressed in a 5 min window of practice
4) Measuring the accuracy %
